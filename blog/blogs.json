        "description": "Feynman diagrams are a powerful way to visualize particle interactions in physics, and the Asymptote language, with its feynman package, provides an elegant tool to create them.

One can adapt these steps for other diagrams by adjusting points, propagators, labels, and vertices as needed. More code examples will be provided at the end of this document for references.",

After I successfully installed ROOT on my Windows 11 OS, I re-examined by steps to arrive at the most efficient way to install ROOT, so I wrote this document hoping it can help others facing same problem.",
